# Hi there 👋, I am Tan Jun Yuan #
I'm student in the Faculty of Computing with a passion for all things tech and gaming. When I'm not buried in lines of code or diving into the world of algorithms, you can usually find me immersed in my favorite mobile games, honing my skills and enjoying some well-deserved downtime. I'm also a big music enthusiast. After a long study session, you'll often catch me with my headphones on, vibing to some tunes to unwind and recharge.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

![System Architecture](Pictures/architecture.png)

The architecture of this sentiment analysis project is designed to support efficient processing and real-time analysis of Grab App reviews. It consists of **five main phases**:

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Data Preparation**
3. **Model Training**
4. **Stream Data Collection**
5. **Visualization**

### 🔹 1. Data Collection

- Review data for the **Grab App** is extracted from the Google Play Store using the [`google-play-scraper`](https://github.com/danieliu/google-play-scraper) library.
- Apache Kafka is used as a **message broker**, allowing the collected review data to be sent to a Kafka topic for further processing.

### 🔹 2. Data Preparation

- The collected data is preprocessed using **Apache Spark (PySpark)**.
- Preprocessing steps include cleaning, normalizing, and structuring the text to prepare it for model training.
- PySpark efficiently handles large volumes of data streamed from Kafka.

### 🔹 3. Model Training

- Cleaned data is saved in **Parquet** format and split into training and testing datasets.
- Two supervised machine learning models are trained using PySpark:
  - **Naive Bayes**
  - **Logistic Regression**
- The models are evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy**, **F1 score**, and **confusion matrix**.

### 🔹 4. Stream Data Collection

- Real-time app reviews are continuously collected from Kafka (`grab_reviews_final` topic).
- Incoming data is preprocessed to match the format used during training.
- The trained model is loaded and applied to the streaming data to predict sentiment.

### 🔹 5. Visualization

- The sentiment predictions are indexed into **Elasticsearch** under the index `grab_reviews_sentiment`.
- **Kibana** is used to visualize the sentiment trends with dashboards showing the distribution of:
  - Positive reviews
  - Neutral reviews
  - Negative reviews

This architecture ensures scalable, near real-time sentiment analysis with a robust pipeline from data ingestion to insightful visualization.

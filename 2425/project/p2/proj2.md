# üìÑ Project 2: Real-Time Sentiment Analysis using Apache Spark and Kafka

## Project Synopsis

This project offers students a hands-on opportunity to design and develop a **real-time sentiment analysis pipeline** using **Apache technologies**. The focus is on collecting and analyzing large volumes of **social media or public review data** to understand user sentiments about a product, event, or social issue relevant to **Malaysia**.

Students will explore **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to clean and process text, develop **machine learning or deep learning models** for sentiment classification, and implement a scalable system architecture using **Apache Spark** for big data processing and **Apache Kafka** for real-time data streaming. The processed insights will be stored and visualized using tools such as **Elasticsearch** or **Apache Druid**.

The project emphasizes **real-time analytics**, **pipeline integration**, and **insight communication** through dashboards and reports, fostering critical thinking, data engineering skills, and teamwork in solving modern data science challenges.

- üìä **Weightage**: 15% of total course assessment
- üïì Project Duration: 4 Weeks
- üìÖ **Submission Deadline**: **Friday, 27 June 2025**
- üì§ **Submission Format**: Final documents via e-learning and GitHub
- üë• **Assignment Type**: **4 students per group (Max)**

> üìå Each group must include students from **different genders, races, or backgrounds** to promote diverse and inclusive teamwork.

## üß† **What Is This Project About?**

You will build a system that **monitors and analyzes public sentiment** in real-time using cutting-edge big data technologies. Choose a dataset from **Twitter, online reviews, or news sources**, clean it, and classify each text entry as **positive, negative, or neutral** using your trained model. Your pipeline will run continuously or on-demand using Apache tools, and the insights will be made visible using dashboards.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Involved

* **Apache Kafka**: Stream text data from live or batched sources.
* **Apache Spark**: Process large-scale data in parallel, apply machine learning models.
* **Apache Elasticsearch or Druid**: Store and visualize sentiment trends.
* **NLP Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers for preprocessing and modeling.

## üéØ **Project Goals**

By completing this project, you will be able to:

1. Set up a **real-time streaming pipeline** with Apache Kafka and Spark.
2. Preprocess text data using **standard NLP techniques**.
3. Train and deploy a **sentiment classification model** (ML or deep learning).
4. Store and visualize results using **Elasticsearch/Druid dashboards**.
5. Collaborate in a diverse team and present actionable insights to stakeholders.

## üìå Project Requirements

### ‚úÖ Technical Requirements:

* Collect or stream data from **Malaysian-relevant sources** (e.g., Twitter, Shopee, local news).
* Preprocess data using NLP methods (cleaning, stemming, tokenization).
* Build and train a sentiment model (at least 2 approaches, e.g., Naive Bayes + LSTM).
* Implement **real-time processing** using Apache Kafka and Spark.
* Store output in **Elasticsearch or Druid** and produce **visual dashboards**.
* Compare the performance of the model across batch and streaming modes.

## üìå Introduction

This project showcases a real-time sentiment analysis pipeline designed to process and visualize opinions from Reddit, focusing on discussions within movie-related subreddits. By leveraging a powerful stack of big data technologies, including **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Spark**, and the **Elastic Stack** (Elasticsearch and Kibana), the system can ingest, analyze, and display sentiment from a continuous stream of Reddit comments. The core of the analysis is a sentiment classification model that categorizes comments as positive, negative, or neutral.

---

## üéØ Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

* **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: To gather a substantial dataset of Reddit comments and clean the text to prepare it for analysis.
* **Model Development and Comparison**: To train and evaluate two distinct sentiment analysis models: a classical **Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes** model and a more advanced **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)** network.
* **Real-Time Data Pipeline**: To build and deploy a Dockerized Apache-based architecture capable of performing near-real-time sentiment analysis on streaming data.
* **Interactive Visualization**: To create a dashboard that presents actionable insights and visual representations of the sentiment data.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

The project is built around a three-tier architecture that facilitates a seamless flow of data from ingestion to visualization.

1.  **Apache Kafka**: Acts as the central nervous system of the pipeline. A Python-based producer script uses the Reddit API to fetch comments in real-time and streams them into a Kafka topic. This provides a scalable and fault-tolerant buffer for the incoming data.

2.  **Apache Spark**: Serves as the processing engine. Spark's Structured Streaming API consumes the data from the Kafka topic, performs necessary cleaning and transformations, and applies the trained sentiment analysis model to each comment.

3.  **Elasticsearch and Kibana**: Form the storage and visualization layer. The processed and sentiment-analyzed data from Spark is indexed in Elasticsearch, a powerful search and analytics engine. Kibana is then used to create interactive dashboards and visualizations, allowing for an in-depth exploration of the data.

The entire architecture is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring portability and ease of deployment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose
* Python 3.8+
* A Reddit API application with `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `user_agent`.

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Project-SentimentAnalysis.git
    cd Project-SentimentAnalysis
    ```

2.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add your Reddit API credentials:
    ```
    REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
    REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
    REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_user_agent
    ```

3.  **Build and start the Docker containers:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

### Running the Pipeline

1.  **Start the Kafka producer** to begin streaming Reddit comments:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec spark python /opt/bitnami/spark/work/kafka_spark_pipeline/kafka_producer.py
    ```

2.  **Submit the Spark streaming job** to start processing the data:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec spark spark-submit \
      --master spark://spark:7077 \
      --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.4.2,org.elasticsearch:elasticsearch-spark-30_2.12:8.13.4 \
      /opt/bitnami/spark/work/kafka_spark_pipeline/spark_streaming.py
    ```

### Accessing the Dashboard

* **Kibana**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5601`.
* **Spark Master UI**: You can monitor the status of your Spark cluster at `http://localhost:8080`.

## üìä Results

The analysis of the Reddit comments yielded several key insights:

* **Sentiment Distribution**: The sentiment was fairly balanced, with a slight tendency towards neutral comments (33.52%).
* **Top Subreddits**: The `r/movies` subreddit was the most active, followed by `r/BoxOffice` and `r/TrueFilm`.
* **Comment Engagement**: The distribution of comment scores was highly skewed, with most comments receiving a low score.

## üõ†Ô∏è Optimization and Comparison

Several optimization techniques were employed to enhance the performance of the sentiment analysis models:

* **Text Preprocessing**: A comprehensive cleaning pipeline was implemented to remove URLs, special characters, and normalize text, which significantly reduced noise.
* **Neutral Class Labeling**: A confidence threshold was used to identify and label neutral comments, improving the accuracy of the models, especially for ambiguous text.
* **Efficient Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF (top 5,000 features) and word embeddings (20,000-word vocabulary) were used for the Na√Øve Bayes and Bi-LSTM models, respectively.
* **Early Stopping**: This technique was used during the training of the Bi-LSTM model to prevent overfitting, with a patience of 2 on a 10% validation split.

### Model Comparison

| Model       | Accuracy    | Precision (Pos/Neg/Neu) | Recall (Pos/Neg/Neu)   | F1-Score (Pos/Neg/Neu) |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Na√Øve Bayes | 0.62        | 0.80 / 0.83 / 0.37      | 0.20 / 0.16 / 0.95     | 0.32 / 0.27 / 0.53     |
| Bi-LSTM     | **0.78** | **0.65 / 0.63 / 0.53** | **0.63 / 0.52 / 0.64** | **0.64 / 0.57 / 0.58** |

The **Bi-LSTM** model significantly outperformed the Na√Øve Bayes model by 16 percentage points in accuracy, demonstrating its ability to capture more complex patterns like sarcasm and code-switching in the text data.

## üèãÔ∏è Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of building a real-time sentiment analysis pipeline using an integrated stack of Apache Kafka, Spark, and Elasticsearch. The system is capable of ingesting, processing, and visualizing large volumes of streaming data from Reddit, providing valuable insights into public opinion on movies. The Bi-LSTM model proved to be more balanced and nuanced compared to the Na√Øve Bayes model, which showed a strong bias towards classifying comments as neutral.

---

## üöÄ Future Work

* **Model Enhancement**: Fine-tuning the Bi-LSTM model's hyperparameters or employing pre-trained transformer models like BERT could further improve sentiment prediction accuracy.
* **Data Expansion**: The pipeline could be extended to include data from other social media platforms like Twitter or a wider range of subreddits to create a more comprehensive analysis.
* **Scalability Improvements**: Further optimizations could be made to the Spark and Kafka configurations, such as adjusting partition strategies, to enhance the scalability and real-time processing capabilities of the system.

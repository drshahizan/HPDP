# 📄 Project 1: Optimizing High-Performance Data Processing for Large-Scale Web Crawlers

## Project Synopsis
This project introduces students to real-world applications of high-performance computing (HPC) in large-scale web data processing. Students will work collaboratively in diverse teams to design, develop, and optimize a web crawler capable of extracting a minimum of **100,000 structured records** from a **Malaysian website**. Emphasis is placed on the practical implementation of **multithreading, multiprocessing, and distributed processing** techniques to improve the efficiency and scalability of the system. 

Through hands-on experience, students will explore data collection, cleaning, transformation, and storage, while addressing technical challenges such as crawl delays, ethical scraping, and performance bottlenecks. The project culminates with a comprehensive performance evaluation comparing pre- and post-optimization results. Deliverables include a final technical report, source code, cleaned dataset, performance analysis, and a group presentation. 

This project aims to develop students' technical skills in high-performance computing, critical thinking in system optimization, and collaboration in diverse teams—key competencies for data science professionals.

📊 **Weightage**: 15% of total course assessment  
🕓 Project Duration: 4 Weeks
📅 **Submission Deadline**: **Friday, 16 May 2025**  
📤 **Submission Format**: All final documents must be uploaded via e-learning and github  
👥 **Assignment Type**: **4 students per group (Max)**. 
> 📌 Each group must include students from **different genders, races, or backgrounds** to encourage diversity and collaboration across cultures and perspectives.

## 🧠 **What Is This Project About?**

This project gives you the chance to **design, build, and optimize a high-performance data processing system** that collects information from the internet. You will create a **web crawler** to extract data from a **Malaysian website** and then process this data using **advanced computing techniques** to make the process faster and more efficient.

### 💡 What makes this “high-performance”?
You are expected to use computing methods that improve performance, such as:
- **Multithreading** – running multiple tasks at the same time
- **Multiprocessing** – using multiple CPU cores for different parts of the program
- **Distributed computing** – spreading the task across several machines or processes (e.g., using Spark)

You will also **compare the performance before and after optimization**, and show what makes your design better.

## 🎯 **Project Goals**

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
1. Build a **web crawler** to extract large amounts of data from a real-world Malaysian website.
2. Process and clean the data to prepare it for analysis or storage.
3. Apply **high-performance computing techniques** to improve the speed and efficiency of your solution.
4. Work as part of a **diverse, collaborative team**.
5. Evaluate your system’s performance and explain how it was improved.
6. Present your work professionally through reports and presentations.

## 📌 **Project Requirements**

### ✅ Minimum Technical Requirements:
- Crawl and collect **at least 100,000 records** from a single Malaysian website.
- Store the data in **CSV, JSON, or a structured database**.
- Clean and process the data (e.g., remove duplicates, standardize fields).
- Apply at least **three optimization techniques** to make your system faster and more efficient.
- Compare **before vs after optimization** using performance metrics.

### ✅ Deliverables (What You Must Submit):
| No. | Item | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Final Report** | A complete document with background, methods, results, and discussion. Must be uploaded to Turnitin (PDF). |
| 2 | **Source Code** | Your crawler and processing pipeline, well organized and commented. Submit as GitHub link or ZIP file. |
| 3 | **Clean Dataset** | At least 100,000 valid, structured records in CSV/JSON/database. |
| 4 | **Performance Comparison** | Include charts or tables comparing performance before and after optimization. |
| 5 | **Presentation Slides** | 10-minute group presentation explaining your project. |

## 🌐 **Suggested Malaysian Websites for Crawling**

Choose only **ONE** website from the list below. You must clearly explain what type of data you will extract and confirm that the website can provide at least **100,000 records**.

> ✅ Each group must get **approval from your lecturer** before starting the crawling process.

## 🧭 **Step-by-Step Project Guide**

### 📍 **Week 1: Planning & Setup**
- Form a group of 4 (with diverse members).
- Choose a target website and identify the data you want to collect.
- Get lecturer approval.
- Design your crawler’s architecture and processing plan.
- Decide which libraries or frameworks to use (e.g., Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Dask, Spark).

### 📍 **Week 2: Crawler Development**
- Build your web crawler to collect real-time data.
- Respect robots.txt and do not overload the website.
- Save data progressively to avoid loss.
- Store in CSV, JSON, or a database.

### 📍 **Week 3: Data Processing & Optimization**
- Clean and transform your data (e.g., fix missing values, remove duplicates).
- Apply at least **two optimization techniques** such as:
  - `threading`, `asyncio`
  - `multiprocessing`
  - `Spark` or `Dask` for large-scale data
- Record your performance (time, memory, CPU usage).

### 📍 **Week 4: Reporting & Submission**
- Create your final report and slides.
- Compare your system’s performance before and after optimization.
- Submit:
  - ✅ Report (via Turnitin)
  - ✅ Code (via GitHub/ZIP)

  - ✅ Performance analysis and presentation slides

## 📊 **Performance Evaluation Criteria**
You must compare the following between your basic and optimized versions:
- Total processing time (in seconds/minutes)
- CPU and memory usage
- Number of records processed per second (throughput)
- Charts/graphs showing improvements

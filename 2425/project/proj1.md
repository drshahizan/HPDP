# 📄 Project 1: Optimizing High-Performance Data Processing for Large-Scale Web Crawlers

## Project Synopsis
This project introduces students to real-world applications of high-performance computing (HPC) in large-scale web data processing. Students will work collaboratively in diverse teams to design, develop, and optimize a web crawler capable of extracting a minimum of **100,000 structured records** from a **Malaysian website**. Emphasis is placed on the practical implementation of **multithreading, multiprocessing, and distributed processing** techniques to improve the efficiency and scalability of the system. 

Through hands-on experience, students will explore data collection, cleaning, transformation, and storage, while addressing technical challenges such as crawl delays, ethical scraping, and performance bottlenecks. The project culminates with a comprehensive performance evaluation comparing pre- and post-optimization results. Deliverables include a final technical report, source code, cleaned dataset, performance analysis, and a group presentation. 

This project aims to develop students' technical skills in high-performance computing, critical thinking in system optimization, and collaboration in diverse teams—key competencies for data science professionals.

📊 **Weightage**: 15% of total course assessment  
🕓 Project Duration: 4 Weeks
📅 **Submission Deadline**: **Friday, 16 May 2025**  
📤 **Submission Format**: All final documents must be uploaded via e-learning and github  
👥 **Assignment Type**: **4 students per group (Max)**. 
> 📌 Each group must include students from **different genders, races, or backgrounds** to encourage diversity and collaboration across cultures and perspectives.

## 🧠 **What Is This Project About?**

This project gives you the chance to **design, build, and optimize a high-performance data processing system** that collects information from the internet.

## 🔗 Recommended Repositories & Tools**

To support your implementation, you may refer to the following **GitHub repositories**, which provide sample code, libraries, and frameworks that are useful for completing your project tasks:

#### 1. **Web Scraping**
[GitHub Repository: python-web](https://github.com/drshahizan/python-web)  
This repository provides examples and tools for building web crawlers using Python libraries such as:
- `Requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for basic scraping
- `Scrapy` for scalable, asynchronous crawling
- Handling of pagination, HTTP headers, and response parsing
Students can explore different techniques and adapt existing scripts to suit their target Malaysian websites.

#### 2. **Big Data Processing**
[GitHub Repository: Python-big-data](https://github.com/drshahizan/Python-big-data)  
Big data processing involves the **systematic handling, transformation, and analysis of large datasets** that are too complex for traditional methods. This repository provides practical examples in:
- Data ingestion from large sources
- Cleaning and transformation using `Pandas`, `Dask`, and `PySpark`
- Batch processing and memory-efficient techniques

Students are encouraged to integrate these tools into their pipeline to **optimize data throughput and minimize execution time**.

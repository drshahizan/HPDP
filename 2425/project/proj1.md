# 📄 Project 1: Optimizing High-Performance Data Processing for Large-Scale Web Crawlers

## Project Synopsis
This project introduces students to real-world applications of high-performance computing (HPC) in large-scale web data processing. Students will work collaboratively in diverse teams to design, develop, and optimize a web crawler capable of extracting a minimum of **100,000 structured records** from a **Malaysian website**. Emphasis is placed on the practical implementation of **multithreading, multiprocessing, and distributed processing** techniques to improve the efficiency and scalability of the system. 

Through hands-on experience, students will explore data collection, cleaning, transformation, and storage, while addressing technical challenges such as crawl delays, ethical scraping, and performance bottlenecks. The project culminates with a comprehensive performance evaluation comparing pre- and post-optimization results. Deliverables include a final technical report, source code, cleaned dataset, performance analysis, and a group presentation. 

This project aims to develop students' technical skills in high-performance computing, critical thinking in system optimization, and collaboration in diverse teams—key competencies for data science professionals.

📊 **Weightage**: 15% of total course assessment  
🕓 Project Duration: 4 Weeks
📅 **Submission Deadline**: **Friday, 16 May 2025**  
📤 **Submission Format**: All final documents must be uploaded via e-learning and github  
👥 **Assignment Type**: **4 students per group (Max)**. 
> 📌 Each group must include students from **different genders, races, or backgrounds** to encourage diversity and collaboration across cultures and perspectives.

## 🧠 **What Is This Project About?**

This project gives you the chance to **design, build, and optimize a high-performance data processing system** that collects information from the internet. You will create a **web crawler** to extract data from a **Malaysian website** and then process this data using **advanced computing techniques** to make the process faster and more efficient.

### 💡 What makes this “high-performance”?
You are expected to use computing methods that improve performance, such as:
- **Multithreading** – running multiple tasks at the same time
- **Multiprocessing** – using multiple CPU cores for different parts of the program
- **Distributed computing** – spreading the task across several machines or processes (e.g., using Spark)

You will also **compare the performance before and after optimization**, and show what makes your design better.

## 🎯 **Project Goals**

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
1. Build a **web crawler** to extract large amounts of data from a real-world Malaysian website.
2. Process and clean the data to prepare it for analysis or storage.
3. Apply **high-performance computing techniques** to improve the speed and efficiency of your solution.
4. Work as part of a **diverse, collaborative team**.
5. Evaluate your system’s performance and explain how it was improved.
6. Present your work professionally through reports and presentations.

## 📌 Project Requirements

### ✅ Technical Requirements:
- Crawl and collect **at least 100,000 records** from a single Malaysian website.
- Store the data in **CSV, JSON, or database**.
- Clean and process the data (e.g., remove duplicates, standardize fields).
- Apply at least **two optimization methods** to make your system faster and more efficient.
- Include performance comparison **(before vs after optimization)**
  
### ✅ Deliverables
| No. | Item | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Final Report** | A complete document with background, methods, results, and discussion. Must be uploaded to Turnitin (PDF). |
| 2 | **Source Code** | Your crawler and processing pipeline, well organized and commented. Submit as GitHub link or ZIP file. |
| 3 | **Clean Dataset** | At least 100,000 valid, structured records in CSV/JSON/database. |
| 4 | **Performance Comparison** | Include charts or tables comparing performance before and after optimization. |
| 5 | **Presentation Slides** | 10-minute group presentation explaining your project. |

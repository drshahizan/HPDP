# üßπ Optimizing High-Performance Data Processing for Large-Scale Web Crawlers ‚Äì PG Mall

![Project Overview](https://www.google.com/imgres?q=pgmall&imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-oss.ginee.com%2Fofficial%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F12%2Fimage-1784-1024x283.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fginee.com%2Fmy%2Finsights%2Fpgmall-seller%2F&docid=sO8yrIJcFJAVjM&tbnid=9npnjETGUkCGcM&vet=12ahUKEwitt82u8qWNAxW3sVYBHbVVGZgQM3oECBwQAA..i&w=1024&h=283&hcb=2&ved=2ahUKEwitt82u8qWNAxW3sVYBHbVVGZgQM3oECBwQAA)

This project focuses on collecting product data from **PG Mall**, cleaning it, and evaluating different Python libraries for performance (Pandas, Polars, and Dask). The goal is to optimize scraping speed and data transformation for better scalability and analysis.

## üîß How This Project Works

This project is structured in 4 main stages:

1. **Web Scraping**  
   Data is scraped from PG Mall using both basic and optimized (multithreaded) techniques. One variant also scrapes data by product subcategories.

2. **Product Type Mapping**  
   Raw products are mapped into defined product types using keyword matching to prepare the data for categorization and visualization.

3. **Data Cleaning**  
   The raw scraped data undergoes cleaning using three different libraries: **Pandas**, **Polars**, and **Dask**. This includes:
   - Removing duplicates
   - Filling missing values
   - Standardizing product names and prices

4. **Performance Evaluation of Optimization**  
   Each method is evaluated based on:
   - Execution time
   - Memory usage
   - CPU utilization
   - Throughput (records per second)

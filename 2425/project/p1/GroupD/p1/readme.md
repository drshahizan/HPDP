### üß™ Code Files

#### üîπ Basic Scraping (Without Optimization)
- [`PgmallScraping_withoutOptimization.ipynb`](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/2425/project/p1/GroupD/p1/PgmallScraping_withoutOptimization.ipynb)  
  ‚û§ Performs basic web scraping and data collection without any performance optimization. Saves raw product data.

#### üîπ Optimized Scraping
- [`PgmallScraping_multithreading.ipynb`](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/2425/project/p1/GroupD/p1/PgmallScraping_multithreading.ipynb)  
  ‚û§ Implements web scraping using multithreading to improve performance and reduce total scraping time.

#### üîπ Scraping by SubCategory
- [`PgmallBySubCategory.ipynb`](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/2425/project/p1/GroupD/p1/PgmallBySubCategory.ipynb)  
  ‚û§ Scrapes product data by subcategory

#### üîπ Mapping for Product Type
- [`Map_ProductType.ipynb`](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/2425/project/p1/GroupD/p1/Map_ProductType.ipynb)  
  ‚û§ Maps raw product to product type categories to assist in analysis.

#### üîπ Basic Cleaning (Without Optimization)
- [`Cleaning_Process_withoutOptimization.ipynb`](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/2425/project/p1/GroupD/p1/Cleaning_Process_withoutOptimization.ipynb)  
  ‚û§ Step-by-step cleaning using **Pandas** only. Checks for nulls/duplicates, cleans price/product fields, and saves cleaned data.

#### üîπ Optimized Cleaning
- [`Cleaning_Process_withPolar.ipynb`](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/2425/project/p1/GroupD/p1/Cleaning_Process_withPolar.ipynb)  
  ‚û§ Cleaning using **Polars** for improved speed and parallelism.

- [`Cleaning_Process_withDask.ipynb`](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/2425/project/p1/GroupD/p1/Cleaning_Process_withDask.ipynb)  
  ‚û§ Cleaning using **Dask** for parallelized processing. Designed to test scalability on larger datasets.

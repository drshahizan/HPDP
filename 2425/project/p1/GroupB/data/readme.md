### üßë‚Äçüî¨ Data Cleaning Process

The dataset underwent several cleaning steps to ensure its quality and usability for analysis:

1. **Handling Missing Values**:  
   - Replaced missing values in `location`, `fuel type`, and `body type` with `'Unknown'`.

2. **Duplicate Removal**:  
   - No duplicates were found in the dataset.

3. **Condition Standardization**:  
   - Standardized the `condition` column, converting entries like `usedcondition` to `used`.

4. **Valid URL Filtering**:  
   - Only valid rows with URLs starting with `http` were retained.

5. **Outlier Handling**:  
   - Removed unreasonable price and mileage values (e.g., negative values).

6. **Column Removal**:  
   - Dropped the `currency` column as it was redundant for analysis.

7. **Text Standardization**:  
   - Converted all string columns to lowercase and stripped any extra spaces.

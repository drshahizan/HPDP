# üîó Recommended Repositories & Tools

To support your implementation, you may refer to the following **GitHub repositories**, which provide sample code, libraries, and frameworks that are useful for completing your project tasks:

## 1. [Web Scraping](https://github.com/drshahizan/python-web)
This repository provides examples and tools for building web crawlers using Python libraries such as:
- `Requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for basic scraping
- `Scrapy` for scalable, asynchronous crawling
- Handling of pagination, HTTP headers, and response parsing
Students can explore different techniques and adapt existing scripts to suit their target Malaysian websites.

## 2. [Big Data Processing](https://github.com/drshahizan/Python-big-data)
Big data processing involves the **systematic handling, transformation, and analysis of large datasets** that are too complex for traditional methods. This repository provides practical examples in:
- Data ingestion from large sources
- Cleaning and transformation using `Pandas`, `Dask`, and `PySpark`
- Batch processing and memory-efficient techniques

Students are encouraged to integrate these tools into their pipeline to **optimize data throughput and minimize execution time**.

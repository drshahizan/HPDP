# 🧭 Step-by-Step Project Guide

### 📍 **Week 1: Planning & Setup**
- Form a group of 4 (with diverse members).
- Choose a target website and identify the data you want to collect.
- Get lecturer approval.
- Design your crawler’s architecture and processing plan.
- Decide which libraries or frameworks to use (e.g., Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Dask, Spark).

### 📍 **Week 2: Crawler Development**
- Build your web crawler to collect real-time data.
- Respect robots.txt and do not overload the website.
- Save data progressively to avoid loss.
- Store in CSV, JSON, or a database.

### 📍 **Week 3: Data Processing & Optimization**
- Clean and transform your data (e.g., fix missing values, remove duplicates).
- Apply at least **two optimization techniques** such as:
  - `threading`, `asyncio`
  - `multiprocessing`
  - `Spark` or `Dask` for large-scale data
- Record your performance (time, memory, CPU usage).

### 📍 **Week 4: Reporting & Submission**
- Create your final report and slides.
- Compare your system’s performance before and after optimization.
- Submit:
  - ✅ Report (via Turnitin)
  - ✅ Code (via GitHub/ZIP)
  - ✅ Dataset (with minimum 100,000 records)
  - ✅ Performance analysis and presentation slides

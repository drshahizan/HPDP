# Week 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing, High Performance Computing, and Data Processing

## **🔹 Definition and Overview**
**High-Performance Data Processing (HPDP)**, also referred to as **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**, is the utilization of **advanced computational resources** to rapidly process and analyze vast amounts of data. This technology is **crucial** for organizations handling **big data**, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), as well as industries requiring real-time analytics (Roscher et al., 2023).

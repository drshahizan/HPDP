### ✨ Project Overview

This assignment delves into the critical area of **big data handling**. The primary objective is to explore and compare various strategies for efficiently processing large datasets that exceed typical memory limits. We begin by implementing and analyzing fundamental techniques within the **Pandas library**, focusing on how methods like **loading less data, chunking, optimizing data types, and sampling** impact **load time, memory usage, and overall processing efficiency**. Subsequently, this project will extend to comparing the performance and suitability of different big data libraries, such as **Dask** and **PySpark**, to identify the most effective tools for handling truly massive datasets and ensuring robust, crash-free data processing.

### 🛠️ Libraries Explored (Current Focus)

* **Pandas:** The primary library used for data manipulation and the implementation of various big data handling strategies.
* `time`, `psutil`, `os`, `gc`: Utilized for performance monitoring (measuring execution time and memory usage) and resource management.

*(Further big data libraries like Dask and PySpark will be explored in subsequent phases of this assignment.)*

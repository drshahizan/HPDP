## 📌 Introduction

This assignment focuses on applying big data handling strategies to efficiently process and analyze datasets exceeding 700MB in size. We explore different strategies such as **chunking**, **sampling**, **data type optimization**, and **parallel processing** with Dask.

## 📝 Assignment Tasks

- **Task 1**: Dataset Selection: Choose a large dataset and provide details.
- **Task 2**: Load and Inspect Data: Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
- **Task 3**: Apply Big Data Handling Strategies: Implement strategies such as chunking, optimization, and parallel processing.
- **Task 4**: Comparative Analysis: Compare the traditional method vs optimized methods (Pandas, Dask, Polars).
- **Task 5**: Conclusion & Reflection: Reflect on what was learned and the benefits of each method.

## 📄 Description

This project explores big data handling strategies using the IMDB Review Dataset (~1GB). We benchmarked three Python libraries: **Pandas**, **Polars**, and **Dask** across five strategies:

-   Normal Load
    
-   Load Less Data
    
-   Use Chunking
    
-   Optimize Data Types
    
-   Sampling (where supported)
    

## 📊 Outcome

We compared execution time and memory usage across all libraries and strategies. Charts and detailed analysis are provided in the main report (`big_data.md`).

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

-   Python (Google Colab)
    
-   Pandas
    
-   Polars
    
-   Dask
    
-   Matplotlib (for visualization)

# Assignment

## üìò [Assignment 1: Academic Writing](ass1.md)
This assignment is designed to develop students' skills in academic writing and critical analysis. Students are required to write a short academic paper based on a selected topic, demonstrating their ability to research, evaluate, and present information in a structured and scholarly format. The assignment encourages independent learning, proper citation practices, and the use of digital tools to support academic work. It also aims to cultivate discipline in managing writing processes through log book documentation.


## üìÑ [Project 1: Optimizing High-Performance Data Processing for Large-Scale Web Crawlers](../project/proj1.md)
This project introduces students to real-world applications of high-performance computing (HPC) in large-scale web data processing. Students will work collaboratively in diverse teams to design, develop, and optimize a web crawler capable of extracting a minimum of **100,000 structured records** from a **Malaysian website**. Emphasis is placed on the practical implementation of **multithreading, multiprocessing, and distributed processing** techniques to improve the efficiency and scalability of the system. Through hands-on experience, students will explore data collection, cleaning, transformation, and storage, while addressing technical challenges such as crawl delays, ethical scraping, and performance bottlenecks. The project culminates with a comprehensive performance evaluation comparing pre- and post-optimization results. Deliverables include a final technical report, source code, cleaned dataset, performance analysis, and a group presentation. This project aims to develop students' technical skills in high-performance computing, critical thinking in system optimization, and collaboration in diverse teams‚Äîkey competencies for data science professionals.

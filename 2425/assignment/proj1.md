## 📄 Project 1: Optimizing High-Performance Data Processing for Large-Scale Web Crawlers

This project introduces students to real-world applications of high-performance computing (HPC) in large-scale web data processing. Students will work collaboratively in diverse teams to design, develop, and optimize a web crawler capable of extracting a minimum of **100,000 structured records** from a **Malaysian website**. Emphasis is placed on the practical implementation of **multithreading, multiprocessing, and distributed processing** techniques to improve the efficiency and scalability of the system. 

Through hands-on experience, students will explore data collection, cleaning, transformation, and storage, while addressing technical challenges such as crawl delays, ethical scraping, and performance bottlenecks. The project culminates with a comprehensive performance evaluation comparing pre- and post-optimization results. Deliverables include a final technical report, source code, cleaned dataset, performance analysis, and a group presentation. 

This project aims to develop students' technical skills in high-performance computing, critical thinking in system optimization, and collaboration in diverse teams—key competencies for data science professionals.

📊 **Weightage**: 15% of total course assessment  
🕓 Project Duration: 4 Weeks
📅 **Submission Deadline**: **Friday, 16 May 2025**  
📤 **Submission Format**: All final documents must be uploaded via e-learning and github  
👥 **Assignment Type**: **4 students per group (Max)**. 
> 📌 Each group must include students from **different genders, races, or backgrounds** to encourage diversity and collaboration across cultures and perspectives.

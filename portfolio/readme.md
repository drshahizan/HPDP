# Task 1: Portfolio Creation 📂

**Objective**: Develop Your Professional Portfolio 🌟

## Overview 📝

You are tasked with creating a comprehensive portfolio that showcases your beliefs, skills, qualifications, education, training, and experiences. A portfolio is a curated collection that offers a glimpse into your personality and work ethic. It's comparable to an [Online Resume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_portfolio) or [C.V.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae). For a clearer understanding, refer to a [sample portfolio here](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme).

## Folder Structure 🗂️

Ensure proper organization by placing your portfolio within the designated 'Portfolio' folder. Within the [`portfolio`](./portfolio) directory, create a folder using your `github_id` as the folder name. The primary file within this folder should be named `readme.md`. You're encouraged to include any relevant files for your portfolio. The suggested folder structure is as follows:

```
📁 portfolio
├── 📁Muhaimin005
│   ├── 📄readme.md
│   └── 📄image.png
├── 📁AlieyaZawanie
│   ├── 📄readme.md
│   └── 📄image1.png
...
└── 📁yruixiang
    ├── 📄readme.md
    └── 📄image.png
```

## Updating Portfolio Information 🔄

To update your portfolio information, follow these steps:

1. Open the file [`student.md`](../student.md) on GitHub.

2. Click on the pencil ✏️ icon to edit the file. Navigate to your information section.

3. Add the following code snippet to incorporate a link to your portfolio in the form of an icon:
   ```html
   <a href="./portfolio/your_folder"><img src="./images/portfolio.png" width="24px" height="24px"></a>
   ```
   Make sure to replace `your_folder` with your own `github_id`.

## Deadline ⏰

- Submit your completed portfolio by **October 23, 2023**, to the 'portfolio' folder.
- Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification. Best of luck with crafting your professional portfolio! 🌟

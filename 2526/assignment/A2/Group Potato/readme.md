## Project Summary

This project evaluates the Netflix User Ratings dataset using big data processing strategies. It compares a traditional Pandas baseline against scalable libraries such as Dask and Polars.

The goal is to measure memory usage and execution time while demonstrating practical techniques for handling large datasets in Google Colab.

## Dataset Snapshot

- **Dataset:** Netflix User Ratings
- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evanschreiner/netflix-movie-ratings
- **Domain:** Entertainment / Recommendation Systems
- **Format:** CSV
- **Size:** 2585.43 MB
- **Rows:** 100,480,507
- **Columns:** 4 (`CustId`, `MovieId`, `Rating`, `Date`)

## Key Techniques Used

- **Load Less Data:** Read only the required columns to save memory.
- **Chunking:** Process the dataset in smaller pieces to avoid out-of-memory errors.
- **Data Type Optimisation:** Downcast numeric fields and convert date columns for lower footprint.
- **Sampling:** Use a smaller subset for fast prototyping.
- **Scalable Processing:** Compare Pandas, Dask, and Polars performance on the same aggregation task.

## Running the Notebook

1. Open `big_data.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Mount Google Drive.
3. Verify the dataset path and file location.
4. Run all cells from top to bottom.

## Notes

- The notebook is built for Google Colab.
- The dataset should be available in Google Drive.
- `big_data.md` contains the full written report.
- `big_data.ipynb` contains the executable code and outputs.

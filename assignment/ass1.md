Google Sheets is a versatile and user-friendly tool for data analysis, enabling you to input, cleanse, visualize, and glean insights from your data. It encompasses essential functionalities like data cleansing, chart generation, fundamental and advanced formulas, as well as data filtering and sorting, coupled with pivot tables and conditional formatting, rendering it exceptionally well-suited for a broad spectrum of analytical endeavors. With its real-time collaborative features, sharing capabilities, and the capacity to construct interactive dashboards, Google Sheets represents an outstanding choice for individuals and teams alike, aiming to undertake data analysis within a collaborative and easily accessible framework, especially when dealing with modest datasets and straightforward computations. This assignment necessitates performing data analysis using Google Sheets' tools. 

## 📚 Project Description

### 1. Introduction

| 2.  | Sales performance | <a href="../images/Ass1b.pdf" ><img src="../images/document.png" width="24px" height="24px"></a> | <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drshahizan/dataset/main/GS/Dataset2.txt" ><img src="../images/dataset.png" width="24px" height="24px"></a> |

### 2. Team Collaboration
🚀 Form project teams comprising a minimum of three and a maximum of four students. Teamwork is essential for this assignment. Please complete the Google Sheets page with your group information [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vLDgDAu2ai9rAOIKUfE1xUfTEvK2ikpXJ_1F-Xqtk_c/edit#gid=305100254).

Any candidate suspected of cheating in the assignment will face disciplinary action, which may include suspension or expulsion from the University. Moreover, any materials or devices found to be in violation of examination rules and regulations will be confiscated.

### 4. Submission Requirements
📝 Prepare a comprehensive document that outlines the step-by-step process for creating the case study. This document should include details about the formulas used. Additionally, you must submit a Google Sheets file containing the results of the case study's execution.

The deadline for submission is **October 26, 2023, at 3:30 PM**. Late submissions will not be accepted and will be disregarded.

### 5. File and Folder Structure 

You must place your file in the submission folder. Within the [`submission/ass1/`](./submission/ass1/) folder, create a folder called your group. Name the default file as `readme.md`.
